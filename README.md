# Course Description Scraper (python3.6)
Just a derivative of other scripts that scrape Portal, it allows you to get course descriptions via course code through terminal without having to click through stuff on the webpage. I'm just too lazy to click through portal for descriptions while using [HyperScheduler](https://Hyperschedule.io)

# Dependencies
## Selenium Webdriver
```
pip install selenium
```
I included the chromedriver in the repo for convenience.

## BeautifulSoup
```
easy_install pip  
pip install BeautifulSoup4
```
